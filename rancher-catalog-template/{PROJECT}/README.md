A demo of rancher catalog template.

Note:

1. This template's name is your project's name, not app's name.

2. A project(catalog template) contains at least one app, an app is a `service` in rancher.

3. Configure your app(s) in docker-compose.yml and rancher-compose.yml, combine them into a work-together project which is called `stack` in rancher.
